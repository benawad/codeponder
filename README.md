# Code Ponder

### A Marketplace for Code Reviews

A project that I'm live coding daily on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/benawad).

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute code or designs. Here's a walkthrough on how to add components to the ui package: https://youtu.be/WDk5O-yaoCQ

  # Installing

1. Clone and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/benawad/codeponder.git
cd codeponder
yarn
```

2. Make sure you have PostgreSQL running on your computer with a database called `codeponder2` and a user who has access to that database with the username `postgres` and password `postgres`

- Windows: https://www.guru99.com/download-install-postgresql.html
- Docker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3gnMSyX-XM
- Linux: you know what your doing

3. Make sure you have Redis running on your computer

- Mac: https://medium.com/@petehouston/install-and-config-redis-on-mac-os-x-via-homebrew-eb8df9a4f298
- Windows: https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-on-windows-10/
- Linux: you know what your doing

4. Build the common and ui package by running the following command in the root directory

```
yarn build:deps
```

5. Setup Github client id and secret by going to https://github.com/settings/applications/new

- you can set `Application name` to anything you want
- `Homepage URL` can be either
  - https://github.com/benawad/codeponder (to connect w/main instance at codeponder.com)
  - https://localhost:3000 (to connect to instance on your computer locally)
- `Authorization callback URL`
  - http://localhost:4000/oauth/github

5. Create a `.env` file in `packages/server` and fill in your client id and secret

```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE>
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASS=postgres
SESSION_SECRET=asjdfkljaklsfs
```

6. While in the `server` package you can start the server with

```
yarn start
```

To verified it worked, you can go to http://localhost:4000

7. While in the `web` package you can start the website with

```
yarn dev
```

The website should be available at http://localhost:3000 now

8. I would recommend running

```
yarn watch
```

In the `ui` package so it rebuilds it whenever you make changes.
